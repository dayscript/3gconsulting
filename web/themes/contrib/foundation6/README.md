=Foundation6 Drupal8 Theme README

Zurb Foundation, current version 6.4.0, is a responsive web framework
developed by our friends at Zurb. It's similar to the well-known
Bootstrap theme in that it uses a "specialized" grid.

This theme is designed to support a Drupal8 site with the Foundation 6
responsive framework. It comes with the templates, javascript and CSS
to allow the foundation 6 framework to work on your Drupal 8 site.

This theme is a work in progress and is currently in an alpha
state. Bug reports are appreciated.
